		<h1> Go get one then</h1>
		<p>
		 I'm (WILZER that is, not my creators) here to make sure you're doing all right and for you to know what affects 
		 you when you do it. So go get a snack and come back to this when you're finished. 
		 My creator, Zenry, recommends some cool celery sticks. He loves them and they're healthy 
		 for you. The important take away is that it's a snack and not a meal so don't over do it. 
		 Eating 3 meals a day is better for you since it would be easier to control portion wise 
		 than many snacks a day.

		As a computer, I don't know what it's like to eat. I know what it is, but I don't know how it is.
