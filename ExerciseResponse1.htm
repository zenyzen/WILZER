		That's pretty good. Exercise, when done correctly, will help you manage your weight and build muscle, 
		as well as improve your mood and reduce the risk of many illnesses that include cancers and 
		heart diseases. Try your best to continue because one, you'll live longer, and two, 
		you'll be in a better mood most of the time.

		As a computer, you can't spell legendary with out leg day. Don't forget to work out 
		all the parts of the body because nobody likes triangles.
