		People like you are amazing. A lot of people fall under this category but often disregard 
		many negative aspects about themselves. This isn't always intentional, it's just that people 
		want to like themselves. But you understand that you cannot be the exact image of the you in 
		your mind but you work on improving yourself to be a better person. By better person, I don't 
		mean as in society standards, I mean a better person in your own eyes. 
		<br>
		<br>
		You have days where you feel tip top and some days where you feel like you're at your lowest point in life. 
		Since this is a general quiz, I can't go into anything specific to talk about but I just want you 
		to know that you are your greatest ally and enemy. Don't judge yourself based off of what friends and people say; 
		I mean you are literally taking a self reflection so you must be value your opinion of yourself. 
		Keep trying to be how you want to see yourself as and remember, you'll always be there to shove yourself down into the mud 
		but you'll always have the chance to pick yourself back up.
