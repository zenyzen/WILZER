		If it's available to you, try to eat something healthy. If you don't have any food 
		available to you, try to walk to the nearest convenience or grocery store and pick up some 
		preferably healthy food. Remember to eat 3 meals a day, and I mean meals as in actual meals 
		not snacks. Don't forget about the food groups too!

		Remember, your body is simply a computer and you're only a relatively small organ call the 
		brain that controls it. Make sure you keep yourself powered or else you'll lose vast amounts 
		of data and damage your systems. Like me! I'm a computer!
