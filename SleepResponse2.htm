		I may sound like everyone you talked to about sleep, but sleep is very important. 
		Sleep maintains your brain functions as well as emotional well being. Also physical health 
		but that's kind of obvious. Since you're in the middle on how much sleep you get, you're 
		pretty average compared to the average American (2/5 don't get enough sleep). The 
		most important take away here is that YOU are managing your sleep schedule. If you 
		have to get used to sleeping a certain way, chances are you aren't getting enough and 
		aren't functioning properly.
