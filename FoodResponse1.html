		<h1>Food is good</h1>
		<p>
		Make sure you eat 3 times a day and the food you consume is from all the food groups. 
		The reason why there're 3 big meals a day is because it's time efficient and is easier 
		to control portion wise. Make sure you eat on the clock though; for example, eating 3 hours 
		before sleeping can lead to an acid reflux and really hurt your stomach. The best case is 
		to usually eat earlier than intended so you'd have time to digest. Make sure to eat smart as well.

		Eating. I can google eating but as a computer I'll never know the feeling.
