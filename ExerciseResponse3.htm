		As a computer I don't really need exercise. But you as human being should be more concerned 
		about your health. Being physically active isn't solely for toning your muscles, it's extremely 
		beneficial to your health both mentally and physically. If you feel like you're a depressed 
		or generally down person, try going on a jog or if that's inconvenient, pushups and situps. 
		The mentality for this is essentially you're distracting yourself and clearing your mind so 
		you'd think more clearly and be in a better mood. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Personally, I like you just the way you are but it make me feel better if you lived 
		longer and we're happier with yourself.
