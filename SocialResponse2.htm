		<h1>That's okay</h1>
		<p>
		If you want, take some time to make plans with them. There are people of all different 
		shapes and sizes so take your time until you find people you feel comfortable around. 
		But don't forget that there are still people out there who would love to meet you, 
		you just haven't met them yet. You don't have to be a social butterfly to do this, 
		simply be yourself. Be how you want yourself to be, keeping your individuality not only 
		improves your self image but it also makes you a much more interesting human being. :D

		As a computer, I have access to a of information to local events. See if you can find 
		something fun you can invite some people to!
