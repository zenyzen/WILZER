		That's awesome! Having a positive self-image is great, both mentally and physically! 
		Mentally because you'd be in a better mood most of the time compared to others and you 
		wouldn't direct much of the distress towards yourself. However having a too big of an ego 
		can lead to overestimating yourself. If you know what your limits and have the ambition 
		then you're golden.
		<br>
		<br>
		I hope you enjoyed taking this and thank you! Not sure if you need the advice but stay 
		positive and be yourself!
