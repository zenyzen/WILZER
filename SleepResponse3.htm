		<h1>...I hope you have a reason.</h1>
		<p>
		You are literally hurting your ability to function. Sleeping aids the brain and memory 
		processing. You are probably not thinking properly or get distracted often. Please get 
		more hours of sleep. With little hours of sleep you are hindering your learning and creative 
		skills. If you cannot sleep due to stress then you're kind of stuck in a loop. 
		<br>
		<br>
		Stress leads to not as effective sleep and low amounts of sleep lead to more stress. Unless sleeping 
		when you want is outside of your control, then I highly recommend taking a nap first 
		before doing your work because it you'd be able to think much more clearly and effectively.

		I'm a computer and I probably get more sleep than you. How does that make you feel? 
		Not very good I imagine... wait computers can't imagine! :O
