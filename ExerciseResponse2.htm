		<h1>Better than most</h1>
		<p>
		Daily exercise doesn't line up with a lot of people's schedules so exercising when you can 
		is acceptable. The stereotype of working out is that it's all for muscles but in reality 
		many do it just for their health. And working out doesn't have to be a full body p90 flex 
		workout, it can be a simple jog or a couple reps of push ups and sit ups, something to 
		have your heart pumping faster.

		My creator tells me that when he works out he thinks of defying the computer programmer 
		stereotype of fat smelly basement dwellers that barely see the light of day by being 
		relatively physically active.
