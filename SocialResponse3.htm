		<h1>Don't worry too much about it</h1>
		<p>
		Whether you're an introvert or extrovert, socializing always depends on the person. 
		As a computer it's exhausting when I have multiple programs running; it literally slows 
		me down. People need time to rest and reenergize themselves. There's nothing wrong with 
		enjoying time alone but it's inevitable in life to avoid socializing. Improving your 
		social skills is very important. Simply hanging out with friends underneath a tree and 
		having a chat is a way my creator recommends of socializing. It's a relaxing chat underneath a 
		calming plant.  
		<br>
		<br>
		Trees are cool. As a computer I respect their decision of isolation.
