		Humans are social creatures so you're doing nature proud. By spending time around people 
		you enjoy, you are improving your mood and mental health. Having people around that you can 
		rely on and talk to is releasing certain hormones that help relieve stress. So by actively 
		spending time like this, you are becoming much more relaxed and enjoyable to be around.
